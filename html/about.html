        <h3 class="banner">Mission:</h3>
        <p>Here at Tempera we've created a website to cater to artists and art lovers.<br>
        As an artist, you will be able to have your own store to reach an audience of eager art patrons.<br>
        YOU are in charge of all delivery and transaction of your art. YOU have complete control over your art; we exist to help you get noticed!<br>
        
        As an art patron, you will be able to view any stores on our website created by artists.<br>
        In each store, an artist will create listings in hopes of catching your eye!<br>
        If you are interested in obtaining the artwork, send them a message through the listing page!<br>

        <p>Hello! We are a web developing duo!<br>
        Hannah specialized in the frontend as Andrew specialized in the backend.<br>
        We've meshed our skillsets in order to provide the art community with an easy way to obtain and sell art.<br>
        At San Diego State University, we noticed many artists didn't have the best platform to get their work noticed.<br>
        We hope this changes that!
